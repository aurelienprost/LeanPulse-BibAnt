<p>
	If things do not work, especially simple things like <tt>bibant -version</tt>, then something is wrong with your configuration. Before
	filing bug reports or emailing us, please do:
</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check your environment variables. Is JAVA_HOME correct and pointing to a valid JRE / JDK (&gt;= 1.5)? If it has quotes or trailing slashes, remove them.</li>
		<li>Is your PATH correct? Is BibAnt on it? What about JRE/bin or JDK/bin? If you've installed BibAnt for the first time with the option
			checked to add BibAnt to the PATH (this is the default), have you restarted your computer? This is sometimes required to get the new
			PATH definition taken in account.</li>
		<li>If a task doesn't do what you expect, run <tt>bibant -verbose</tt> or <tt>bibant -debug</tt> to see what is happening.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		If you can't fix your problem, send us <a href="mailto:dev@leanpulse.com?subject=Issue with BibAnt">an email</a>.
	</p>
