# BibAnt
BibAnt is a command-line tool whose mission is to fully automate the generation of PDF documentation packages (also known as “bibles”). BibAnt leverages the power of Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/), the software tool for automating build processes, and implements additional tasks to perform all the actions required to directly build distributable documentation packages.

## How to build
Directly clone this repository in Eclipse 4.3 or above and then run **BibAnt-build-setup.launch** to automatically build a Windows installer.

The build process is implemented by an Ant script and may **requires additional software and configuration** to execute correctly. Please refer to the *build/build.xml* file in the project to learn more about the prerequisites.

## Enjoy !
